\textbf{Summary in layman's terms}\\
\textcolor{Gray}{1499/1500 characters}\\
A Markov chain is a very popular probabilistic model, successful at describing the uncertain time evolution of various systems. 
It can be in any one of several states, and moves between them as time progresses. 
At each time and in each state, it is uncertain which state it will move to next, and this uncertainty is modelled by transition probabilities, assumed to depend only on the current state. 

It turns out to be quite simple to make predictions about the future behaviour of a Markov chain, and this makes it a popular tool in various applied domains, including engineering, artificial intelligence, mathematical finance and bio-informatics. 
But, to make these predictions reliable, perfect knowledge of the transition probabilities---the parameters---of the Markov chain is required, and such knowledge is seldom available. 
An efficient way of dealing with this problem, is to allow for partially specified transition probabilities, using the theory of imprecise probabilities.

In the recent past, this idea has led to the successful development of so-called imprecise Markov chains in discrete time, and the universities of Ghent and Ljubljana have been at the forefront of this research. 
This project aims to formalise this mutual interest, and to use our combined expertise to develop a theory and toolbox for dealing with imprecise Markov chains in continuous time, making it possible to apply imprecise Markov chains in real-life problems, most of which involve continuous time.

% *** {\bf\color{blue} you can also ask for equipment, but that is for large and very costly equipment, which does not apply to us} ***

% !! The FWO rules only apply to the Belgian part of the funding.

% We also have to specify the Slovenian funding in detail, but the FWO will only check basic rules for that funding, such as that the maximum cannot exceed the Slovenian limit, and that the Belgian part of the funding should be larger than the Slovenian part. The details of the Slovenian funding will be checked by the Slovenian agency, which means that if they are OK with using the funding to partially pay people, then the FWO does not care about that (except maybe for the supervisor, I'm not yet 100\% sure about that). Similarly for putting the same Slovenian person on multiple projects: if the Slovenian agency agrees, then it should be OK from an administrative point of view. However, I do think that we should be careful with this. If the jury notices that the same person intends to work (get payed from) two different projects, perhaps this has a negative effect on our chances.

% {\color{Gray}These are the rules (for the Belgian part of the funding):

% You are not allowed to request funding for foreign institutions or institutions belonging to the French-speaking community of Belgium. The staff and consumables that are applied for in the first year, have to be equal or higher compared with the funds asked for during the other years. 

% For each project, and in case of an interuniversitairy project, for each host institution, one can apply for €45.000 till €130.000 each year including research staff and consumables. In case one of the project partners only requests funding for consumables, the lower limit for this partner is set at €20.000. 

% The real cost is used when the name(s) of the researcher(s) is (are) already known. When the name(s) of the researcher(s) is (are) not yet known, the following amounts may be used as indicative costs:

% ·         Bursary: €45,000

% ·         Scientific staff, 0 years of seniority: €65,000

% ·         Postdoc researcher, 4 years of seniority: €85,000

% ·         Technical staff, 6 years of seniority: €50,000


% Additionally, it is possible to request funds for equipment up to €150.000. Matching funding is allowed up to €150.000.

% {\bf\color{blue}*** We need to include a (standard) CV for the personnel that will be appointed on the project (if we know them already).

{\bf Motivation of panel choice}\\[6pt]
This project aims to develop a theory of imprecise continuous-time Markov chains. On the one hand, this topic finds applications in such fields as queueing theory, which abound in computer and telecommunication networks. On the other hand, this topic falls squarely within the field of imprecise probabilities. Probabilistic approaches have always been prominent in artificial intelligence and data mining, and recently, the more specific case of imprecise probabilities has been well received at various AI conferences (best student paper award at ECSQARU 2013 and UAI 2013 and best paper award at ECSQARU 2013). For these reasons, the expert panel should be eminently able to judge the merits and impact of this research proposal.\\[8pt]

- Knowledge representation and reasoning.

% There were also some other relevant disciplines in the list (Artificial intelligence, Differential equations and mathematical physics, Functional analysis, Financial mathematics, Mathematical modelling, Algorithms and computational mathematics, Statistics) but I think it would not be tactical to include them, since they are mostly mathematical, and we are applying to the computer science panel.

\textit{Elaborate on the complementary expertise of the project partners and explain how the project parts are integrated and relevant for the scientific input from both sides.

At Ghent University, the research for this project will be conducted by the Imprecise Probability unit of IDLab, which has world-leading expertise in basic and applied research on imprecise probabilities.
The group is led by Gert de Cooman, who is Full Professor in Uncertainty Modelling and Systems Science, and Honorary Visiting Professor at Durham University.
It currently consists of one post-doc (Jasper De Bock) and four PhD students, who work in a wide range of areas in imprecise probabilities, including credal networks, (mainly discrete-time) imprecise Markov chains and queueing, and the foundations of statistical and probabilistic inference.

At the University of Ljubljana, research for this project will be led by Damjan \v{S}kulj, who is an associate professor of Applied Mathematics. 
He has many years of experience in working with imprecise probabilities, and over the last couple of years, he has published several articles on discrete-time imprecise Markov chains. 
Recently, he has published a preliminary study of imprecise continuous-time Markov chains, which has served as the basis for the line of research that we propose here.
Within the context of this project, he aims to build his own research group, which will initially consist of a new PhD student.

Both of the project partners have been actively involved in the development of imprecise discrete-time Markov chains, to the extent that they are recognised as the two main authorities on the topic. 
Clearly, this expertise will be a major asset for the project, which aims to develop a theory of \emph{continuous-time} Markov chains. In fact, both project partners have recently started to study this topic, be it at a rather preliminary level. The aim of this project is to join forces in our further study of this topic, rather than continue to conduct it separately. We expect this collaboration to be fruitfull because both groups tend to approach the topic of imprecision in Markov chains from partly different and complementary angles.

The focus of the UGhent group lies more on developing the basic theory of imprecise Markov chains within the context of more general stochastic processes, and to place this theory on solid mathematical grounds. 
The focus of the Ljubljana group is more numerically and computationally oriented. 
Both approaches, however, are interlinked and dependent on each other. 
On the one hand, given the complexity of imprecise probability models, theoretical results will be required in order to be able to develop efficient computational methods. 
On the other hand, again due to the inherent complexity of imprecise models, theoretical problems that can traditionally be solved analytically---such as finding limit distributions---will now require the use of efficient computational methods. 
Therefore, we expect our respective approaches to be mutually beneficial.


%As is the case for any theory that uses imprecise probabilities, the aim is to develop methods that enable reasoning with partially known parameters, which consistently produces models that are of much greater complexity than their precise counterparts. It is therefore important that their interpretation remains within the spirit of the general theory of probability and at the same time the complexity must be reasonable in order to be useful and applicable in practice.

The two research partners for the project both have strong ties with other leading researchers in imprecise probabilities, and their members have been actively involved in SIPTA (Society for Imprecise Probability: Theories and Applications), which is an umbrella organisation (and statistical society) that joins researchers on imprecise probabilities from different groups all over the world and promotes their work. 
On the one hand, members of both groups have been involved in the organisation of several events for this society, including the series of biennial ISIPTA conferences (International Symposia on Imprecise Probability: Theories and Applications) and SIPTA summer schools, and the series of WPMSIIP workshops (Workshop on Principles and Methods of Statistical Inference with Interval Probability). 
On the other hand, the supervisor of this project (Gert de Cooman) is a founding member and former president of this society, and the co-supervisor (Jasper De Bock) is a current at-large member of its executive committee. 
The partners in this project also have ties with other leading research groups in imprecise probabilities, at Carnegie Mellon University (US), IDSIA (Switzerland), Durham University (UK), Universidade de S\~ao Paulo (Brazil), IRIT (France), Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\"at M\"unchen (Germany), Universidad de Oviedo and Universidad de Granada (Spain), Universiteit Utrecht (The Netherlands), and University of Trieste (Italy).

\textcolor{Gray}{1008/1800 characters}

The two partners for this project were both invited to contribute to the book ``Introduction to Imprecise Probabilities'' (Wiley, 2014). 
In particular, as a consequence of their mutual interest and expertise in imprecise Markov chains, Damjan \v{S}kulj (the foreign supervisor of this project) and Filip Hermans (a former member of the Ghent group) jointly wrote the ``Stochastic processes'' chapter of this book, in which they introduce a general theory of imprecise stochastic processes, with an emphasis on the theory of discrete-time imprecise Markov chains.

Other forms of cooperation between the project partners were of a more informal nature. 
In the context of their common participation in---and their membership in the programming committees of---the series of ISIPTA conferences, the members of both groups have met on multiple occasions, and they have used these opportunities to discuss their work on imprecise Markov chains. 
Such informal discussions lie at the basis of this joint project proposal.

\textbf{Indicate the state of the art.}
\vspace{-2pt}

This project is concerned with imprecise Markov chains: robust generalisations of Markov chains, based on the theory of imprecise probabilities. 
In this state of the art section, we briefly introduce Markov chains and imprecise probabilities, explain how they can be combined to obtain imprecise Markov chains, and then go on to give an overview of recent advances in this field.

% \vspace{5pt}
\emph{Markov chains}\\[5pt]
A \emph{discrete-time} \emph{finite-state} \emph{Markov chain} is a special stochastic process. 
It models the time evolution in discrete time steps of a system that can be in a finite number of states.
It is \emph{stochastic} because the model is given in terms of probabilities, such as the probability to be in a given state at a given time.
It is a Markov chain because it satisfies a \emph{Markov condition}: the transition probability to be in a certain state at the next time step only depends on the current state, and not on the past states.
The probabilistic time evolution of the state of such Markov chains is described by linear difference equations.
In \emph{continuous-time Markov chains}, the time steps become infinitesimally small, and their time evolution is described by linear differential equations. 
Both discrete and continuous-time Markov chains belong to the most powerful, and---due to their reasonable computational complexity---the most widely used probabilistic models in a very wide range of applications in engineering (filtering, control, queueing), AI (text and speech recognition), mathematical finance and bio-informatics, to name only a few domains.

% \vspace{5pt}
\emph{Imprecise probabilities and the limitations of precise models}\\[5pt]
Nevertheless, these Markov chains have limitations: we will focus here on two of them.
The first is that the uncertainty about the state is described by (transition) probabilities: real numbers whose precision is almost always unwarranted in applications, because of the limited accuracy and reliability of statistical estimation methods, and the essentially limited numerical accuracy that computer simulations offer.
The second limitation is related to the Markov condition: that the probabilistic model for the next state depends only on the current one, is quite a strong assumption to make. 
It leads to a drastic decrease in computational complexity, and is therefore often made, but is typically hard to justify in practical applications.
The justification that is commonly given for both of these assumptions in modelling contexts is that the simplification they entail is unlikely to have major implications for the conclusions that we draw from the models.
However, this claim is hard to verify, and often unwarranted.
As a brief look at the mathematics of these stochastic models will already show, there are many situations where (i) the conclusions of a Markov chain analysis depend heavily and crucially on the precise values of the transition probabilities, or where (ii) not making a Markov assumption leads to qualitatively very different results.

Interestingly, in recent decades much progress has been made in extending the existing corpus of general probabilistic knowledge to deal with both types of limitations: the field of \emph{imprecise probabilities} \cite{walley1991,augustin2013:itip,troffaes2013:lp} has, amongst other things, developed well-justified, mathematically rigorous, as well as robust and efficient methods for dealing with both of them.
Stated in very simple terms, an imprecise probability model is a probabilistic model that is partially specified.
For example, whenever it is infeasible to reliably estimate the probability of some event, the theory of imprecise probabilities allows for the use of a probability interval instead.
Such partial specifications do not lead to a unique probability measure, but instead give rise to a set of compatible probability measures.
These sets of probability measures are called credal sets.
They are the basic uncertainty models in imprecise probability theory. 
A credal set can be represented equivalently by a so-called \emph{lower expectation}: a non-linear operator that is the lower envelope of the linear expectation operators associated with the probability measures in the credal set.
Remarkably, the state of the art in the theory is able to perform the necessary robust calculations and derivations for all of the (infinite number of) precise probability measures in such a credal set, with a computational efficiency that is not much lower than---and often as low as---the one for the precise models; see for instance \cite{cooman2009,debock2014:estihmm,debock2015:thesis,cooman2008} for concrete examples that substantiate this claim.

% \vspace{5pt}
\emph{A brief introduction to imprecise discrete-time Markov chains}\\[5pt]
Applying the results and ideas developed in the field of imprecise probabilities has led to interesting advances in \emph{discrete-time} finite-state Markov chains, resulting in a theory of so-called \emph{imprecise Markov chains} \cite{cooman2008,hermans2012,hartfiel1998,skulj2013,cooman2015:markovergodic}.
They correspond to a collection of stochastic processes that are only `superficially Markov', in the sense that their \emph{sets} of transition probabilities satisfy a Markov condition, whereas the individual members of those sets need not.
Imprecise Markov chains are \emph{not} simply collections of precise Markov chains, but rather correspond to collections of general stochastic processes whose transition models belong to sets that satisfy a Markov condition.
In this sense, they lead to more robust and reliable inferences than their precise counterparts, and nevertheless still allow for very efficient and elegant computations, a combination that is clearly important in applications.

\emph{Imprecise probability trees and submartingales}\\[5pt]
A crucial step that made these developments possible was the observation that general discrete-time stochastic processes can be described elegantly using probability trees: graphs whose \emph{paths} from root to leaves represent possible time evolutions of the process, whose nodes (called \emph{situations}) represent time evolutions up to a certain time step, and where each situation has a local probability model for what may happen at the next time step.
The paths correspond to the elements of the sample space in the more conventional measure-theoretic approach.
With such a tree there is associated a convex closed set of so-called martingales---real processes with zero expected increase from one time step to the next---and an important result by Ville \cite{ville1939,shafer2001} shows that all probabilistic properties of, and inferences about, the stochastic process are completely determined by this set of martingales. Going to imprecise stochastic processes now becomes fairly straightforward, at least conceptually: the local models in the tree's nodes are now sets of probabilities, and all probabilistic inferences are, through an extension of Ville's Theorem, characterised by the corresponding convex closed set of \emph{sub}martingales (real processes with non-negative expected increase under all precise probability models in these sets) \cite{cooman2007d,cooman2015:markovergodic}.

\emph{State of the art for discrete-time imprecise Markov chains}\\[5pt]
There have been several approaches to extending Markov chain theory to deal with imprecision. 
Hartfiel \cite{hartfiel1998}, using the name \emph{Markov set-chains}, focussed on lower and upper bounds for the transition probabilities between individual states, and also discussed sets of transition operators, recognising the importance of convexity of sets of distributions over states, separately specified rows and coefficients of ergodicity. 
Unaware of Hartfiel's work, Kozine and Utkin~\cite{utkin:02} proposed an approach with a different underlying interpretation, and very different computational aspects. 
Instead of allowing transition probabilities to vary within given bounds from one time step (or state) to the next, they assumed a single precise but unknown Markov model: they worked with sets of precise Markov chains. 

The first systematic and fully rigorous approach to combining discrete-time Markov chains with imprecise probabilities is due to De Cooman et al.~\cite{cooman2008}, using the idea of lower conditional expectations---also called lower transition operators. 
Similar ideas were explored independently by Škulj~\cite{skulj:09}, who focussed instead on interval probability models and their associated convex sets of probability distributions. 
For calculations and inferences, the main difference between the two approaches is that the lower transition operator approach in \cite{cooman2008} allows for very efficient backwards induction, in contrast with the much less efficient forward calculations typical in the sets of distributions approaches \cite{skulj:09}. 
Lower transition operators, and the ideas used in the analysis of the limit behaviour of imprecise Markov chains, introduced in \cite{cooman2008}, became the basis for most of the later work on imprecise Markov chains. 
They also emerge naturally as special cases in the above-mentioned theory of imprecise stochastic processes based on imprecise probability trees and closed convex sets of submartingales~\cite{cooman2015:markovergodic}.

One topic that has been studied extensively, is the limit---or stationary---behaviour of imprecise Markov chains, which is very important and useful when looking at practical applications.
Necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence to a unique attractor, expressed in terms of properties of transition operators, were studied by De Cooman and Hermans \cite{cooman2008,hermans2012}. %: although such convergence seems easier to attain for imprecise Markov chains, its characterisation becomes rather more involved.
Škulj and Hable \cite{skulj2013} characterised unique convergence in terms of coefficients of ergodicity: in addition to providing conditions for convergence, these also measure its rate. 
When there is no unique attractor, imprecise Markov chains display a very different behaviour from precise models. 
The analysis of accessibility between states becomes much more complicated, as does the analysis of the structure of invariant imprecise distributions. 
Škulj \cite{skulj:13b} provided a general classification of such invariant distributions. Also practically useful is the so-called conditional convergence for Markov chains with absorbing states and certain absorption: in the long run the chain will be absorbed into the absorbing state, but the distribution conditional on the event the chain has not yet been absorbed may still converge to a stationary distribution. 
For imprecise Markov chains, this problem was solved by Crossman and Škulj \cite{Crossman:2010}.
% proved the existence of a unique imprecise stationary conditional distribution under regularity assumptions. 

More recent work has begun to address other practically useful properties of imprecise discrete-time Markov chains.
Škulj \cite{skulj:2016b} uses coefficients of ergodicity to measure the sensitivity of imprecise Markov chains to perturbations in its parameters. 
A systematic study of expected time to absorption, expected return times, stopping times, hitting  probabilities, and ergodicity was initiated in \cite{troffaes:2013, cooman2015:markovergodic}, but a complete theory is still under development. 
%Time reversal and reversible Markov chains rely on specific properties of transition operators and stationary distributions that turn out to be quite hard to extend to their imprecise versions. 
%Although a complete description of reversible processes is not yet possible, 
A preliminary study of time-reversal  was made by Škulj~\cite{skulj2016}, for a special family of imprecise Markov chains that are obtained as random walks on weighted graphs. 

\emph{State of the art for continuous-time imprecise Markov chains}\\[5pt]
The discussion above, as well as the bulk of the literature on imprecise Markov chains, deals mainly with their discrete-time variant: very little is known about how to deal with robustness and imprecision in continuous-time Markov chains. 
Imprecise continuous-time Markov chains can be related---be it rather artificially---to continuous-time Markov decision processes and controlled Markov chains; these notions share the basic idea of multiple possible transition scenarios.
Addressing them using the ideas and efficient techniques of imprecise probabilities has only been attempted very recently \cite{skulj2015,Troffaes+GSB-ISIPTA15p,DeBock:2016:iCTMClimit,rottondi2017:flexigrid,erreygers2017:ictmcs}.
Many basic conceptual, theoretical and computational problems have yet to be solved, and the relationship with continuous-time versions of imprecise probability trees and closed convex sets of submartingales has yet to be explored.
% I removed the section below because we were failing to adhere to the page limit, and because these things are mentioned further on anyway.
%So far, Škulj \cite{skulj2015:continuous:bounds} has used ideas from the discrete-time approach to introduce imprecise versions of transition rate matrices and establish an appropriate counterpart for Kolmogorov's backward equation, leading to a non-linear differential state evolution equation. He proved that it has maximal and minimal solutions that characterise all possible solutions. Finding these boundary solutions numerically is still very much a problem under study, but has huge potential for practical applications.

\textbf{Describe the objectives of the research.}\\
\textit{Describe the envisaged research and the research hypothesis, why it is important to the field, what impact it could have, whether and how it is specifically unconventional and challenging.}

The main objective of the proposed research project is to make significant progress in the development of the theory of imprecise \emph{continuous-time} \emph{finite-state} Markov chains, using recent developments in imprecise probabilities \cite{augustin2013:itip,troffaes2013:lp} and imprecise probability trees \cite{shafer2001,cooman2007d}, and building on what has already been achieved in the discrete-time case \cite{cooman2008,hermans2012,skulj2013,cooman2015:markovergodic}. In particular, we want to study the following subtopics; more detailed information is provided in the Methodology section below.
% \vspace{6pt}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\tiny$\blacksquare$,leftmargin=*,noitemsep]
\item Develop a rigorous martingale-theoretic and measure-theoretic definition for the joint model of a continuous-time imprecise Markov chain, and use this model to generalise a number of basic theoretical properties of precise continuous-time Markov chains.
\item Develop computational methods for imprecise continuous-time Markov chains and conduct a theoretical analysis of their efficiency, with a particular focus on convergence speed (coefficients of ergodicity) and stability (perturbation analysis).
\item Study and characterise the limit behaviour of imprecise continuous-time Markov chains: ``Under which conditions will they converge to a stationary limit distribution?'', ``What properties does such a limit distribution have?'' and ``How can we efficiently compute it?''.
\end{enumerate}
% \vspace{6pt}
Over the past decades, similar lines of research have received plenty of attention for \emph{precise} continuous-time Markov chains, and this has resulted in their successful application in various domains, including control engineering, queueing, artificial intelligence, bio-informatics and survival analysis.
However, for \emph{imprecise} continuous-time Markov chains, these topics are almost completely unexplored.
%Therefore, we believe that this research could lead to a breakthrough in applied imprecise probability: if successful, our results will provide a theoretical basis that allows for the application of imprecise continuous-time Markov chains in the very same domains where precise continuous-time Markov chains are currently being used.
Our research hypothesis is that by developing these three lines of research, it will become technically feasible to successfully apply imprecise discrete-time discrete-state Markov chains to the same types of problems that are currently solved with their precise versions, and provide them with more robust solutions.

Indeed, the practical advantage of our `imprecise' approach is that it explicitly acknowledges that we may not know the relevant probabilistic models exactly, and that, as a result, our inferences must be robust against such model uncertainty. 
The framework of results and inference methods to be developed will be able to predict the effect of this model uncertainty on specific interesting functions of state variables, for example by providing lower and upper bounds on their expectations. 
The results of such inferences can then be used in various applications to make predictions that are robust against modelling errors. In discrete time, examples can be found in a wide range of domains, including, gesture recognition~\cite{soullard2017:gesturerecognition}, optical character recognition~\cite{debock2014:estihmm}, ecology \cite{samuels2009phd} and finance~\cite{niemiec2007:bonusmalus}. For the continuous-time case, however, there are only two preliminary applications, in telecommunication networks~\cite{rottondi2017:flexigrid} and power system analysis~\cite{Troffaes+GSB-ISIPTA15p}. The aim of this research project is to develop theoretical results and computational methods for this continous-time case, thereby making it possible to tackle a wide range of real applications.

%Other possible applications include assessment of transition-rate importance (\cite{ramirez2015assessment}) and maintenance optimization (\cite{baraldi2013maintenance, compare2015genetic}). 

%% addition about the applications
%\emph{Relation with other fields}

%Imprecision can be present in virtually every area of application of Markov chains, which makes our proposed models immediately applicable in a variety of fields. The recently proposed discrete time Markov chain model has received attention in reliability theory. It has been shown that imprecise Markov chains are very suitable for model checking (\cite{troffaes:2013}). We therefore expect the continuous time models to be directly applicable in continuous time model checking. 

The proposed research is unconventional from the perspective of both domains that intersect in this project.
From the point of view of Markov chain theory, it is unconventional because it does away with two traditional assumptions: the Markov condition is replaced by a weaker version, and the probabilities that make up the model do not have to be specified exactly. 
And from the imprecise probability perspective, this project is unconventional because time is taken to be continuous, whereas past research on imprecise stochastic processes has focussed almost unanimously on discrete-time problems.

Due to the unconventional nature of the proposed research, and because the topic is largely unexplored, the project will clearly be challenging. 
However, given the extensive experience of both partners in studying various aspects of imprecise \emph{discrete-time} stochastic processes~\cite{cooman2007d,cooman2008,hermans2012,cooman2015:markovergodic,debock2014:estihmm}, and because we can build on our preliminary work on the continuous-time case~\cite{DeBock:2016:iCTMClimit,erreygers2017:ictmcs,rottondi2017:flexigrid,skulj2015}, we are convinced that we have the necessary expertise to successfully tackle this project.

As explained in the objectives section, we intend to pursue three lines of research, each of which has been very successful for precise continuous-time Markov chains, but none of which has so far seen significant progress in the imprecise case; a detailed plan is outlined below. 
Each research line will initially be carried out by a dedicated full-time PhD student, under the close supervision of the (co-)supervisors and a part-time senior researcher. 
As time and research progresses, we expect these research lines to benefit from each other, leading to intensive collaborations between the respective students (and their supervisors). Concrete topics for collaboration are discussed within the following detailed plans.

\emph{Joint models and basic properties} {\bf (Research Line 1)}.\\[3pt]
A first important goal of this project is to develop a rigorous martingale-theoretic and measure-theoretic definition for the joint models of a continuous-time imprecise Markov chains, and to use these models to generalise a number of basic theoretical properties of precise continuous-time Markov chains. 
%This research will be conducted by a single student, under the close supervision of the IP unit of the Data Science Lab, and can be divided into the following six work packages.
This research can be divided into the following three work packages.
% \vspace{6pt}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\tiny$\blacksquare$,leftmargin=*,noitemsep]
% \item[\tiny$\blacksquare$]
% The first step in this line of research will be for the student to \emph{study the relevant existing literature on imprecise probabilities and imprecise stochastic processes} as described above, and to familiarise herself thoroughly with measure-theoretic and martingale-theoretic approaches to probability {\bf(Work Package 1a)}.
\item The first step will consist in \emph{investigating how to define an imprecise probability tree, and in particular an imprecise Markov chain, in continuous time}: what are the possible paths and nodes, how can we define local imprecise probability models attached to these nodes, and how do we formulate a Markov condition for them?
In addition, it must be investigated how to define the submartingales associated with such a continuous-time imprecise probability tree, and whether and how this definition simplifies when we impose the Markov condition {\bf(Work Package~1a)}.
To achieve this, we can draw inspiration from earlier game-theoretic probability work on continuous-time stochastic processes\cite{vovk1993:forecasting,vovk2016:richquick}. 
%\cite{vovk2008:brownian,vovk2012:emergence:of:probability}, a special case of a Markov chain.
% with fully independent local models.
%Indeed, much of the this line of research can be seen to consist in generalising and extending his ideas from Brownian motion to Markov chains.
%Therefore, the fact that solid and very interesting results can be obtained for Brownian motion---which is a special case of a Markov chain with fully independent local models---strongly indicates that the present line of research is indeed feasible, though not trivial.
\item In a second step, we use the results of the first to obtain an expression for the joint probability model---a so-called lower expectation operator on the sample space of possible paths---of an imprecise continuous-time Markov chain that is amenable to further exploration {\bf(Work Package 1b)}.
We also investigate whether this lower expectation operator can be expressed as a lower envelope of expectation operators associated with more traditional, measure-theoretic stochastic processes.
%It may also be interesting, if rapid progress can be made and time allows it, to find out whether---as in the discrete-time case \cite{cooman2015:isipta:markov,cooman2015:markovergodic}---such an expression for the joint will allow for a formulation of ergodic theorems for continuous-time imprecise Markov chains.
\item The final step consists in studying the mathematical properties of the continuous-time imprecise Markov model {\bf(Work Package 1c)}.
As a first special case, we intend to check whether it allows for a derivation from first principles of a non-linear variant of the Chapman--Kolmogorov equations, similar to what \v{S}kulj \cite{skulj2015} found using more {\itshape ad hoc} arguments.
That something similar is possible---and fairly straightforward---in the discrete-time case \cite{cooman2008}, should serve as an indication that this is indeed feasible. 
A second special case will be to define stopping times, and to study their basic properties.
\end{enumerate}
Since the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations and stopping times lie at the basis of many computational methods for (precise) continuous-time Markov chains, we expect Work Package~1c to yield results that are useful to advance the second---computational---line of research that we are about to introduce (especially Work Package~2b). In order to take advantage of this overlap, we will provide the respective researchers with the opportunity to collaborate on these topics.

\emph{Computational methods} {\bf (Research Line 2)}.\\[3pt]
While precise Markov chain theory often relies heavily on linear algebra, this is no longer true for imprecise Markov chains, where we need to resort to linear programming techniques. 
Consequently, in the majority of cases, solutions have to be obtained in numerical form.
Computational methods are therefore important, and must be developed alongside with theoretical concepts. 
The second general goal of this project is therefore to develop and improve numerical methods. We foresee four work packages.

%This is especially true for the continuous time case, because in principle we would have infinite number of time steps where a linear programming problems would have to be solved. 
%Instead of that we have to do some kind of discretisation. 
%But this approach generates errors, that have to be managed. 
%Moreover, the existing methods capable of providing bounds of distributions at given finite time points~\cite{skulj2015} fail when it comes to infinite time intervals. 
%Actually, they start behaving poorly when the time intervals become larger. 
%The reason is that they are based on the theory of differential equations whose bounds grow exponentially in time.
% \vspace{6pt}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\tiny$\blacksquare$,leftmargin=*,noitemsep]
\item The first step will be to define and compute coefficients of ergodicity (and other contraction measures) for imprecise continuous-time Markov chains {\bf(Work Package 2a)}. 
By analogy with the discrete-time case~\cite{skulj2013}, we expect it will be difficult to evaluate the theoretical definitions directly, so indirect computational methods will need to be developed. 
In order to do so, we will start by designing efficient methods for computing distances between partially specified coherent lower previsions. 
%Known numerical examples suggest that this problem is challenging but solvable. 
%To solve this problem we will use methods of convex analysis and the theory of perturbations of linear programming problems.
\item The next task {\bf(Work Package 2b)} is to develop methods for calculating tight bounds on expectations %of functions of the states of 
in
an imprecise Markov chain. 
First, we intend to extend existing methods for functions that depend on the state at a single time in the future~\cite{skulj2015,erreygers2017:ictmcs}, which fail---or become too conservative---when the time interval is large. 
To overcome this, we intend to exploit the contracting nature of Markov transition operators, using the coefficients of ergodicity of Work Package 2a. 
Next, we will also try and compute expectations for more general functions, including special cases of the stopping times of Work Package 1c, such as the expected time to absorption and expected return times.%---and probabilities of general events---absorption probabilities.
\item The third task {\bf(Work Package 2c)} is error estimation.
Regardless of the method used, numerical errors seem inevitable in continuous-time models, where only a finite number of optimisation steps are feasible, whereas in theory, an optimisation would actually be needed in each intermediate time point. 
This gives rise to numerical errors, which are in every step transferred to the next steps as perturbations. 
Existing error estimates work well for short time intervals, but tend to significantly overestimate the errors for larger time intervals, as has been observed experimentally in simple problems~\cite{erreygers2017:ictmcs,skulj2015}.
\item An important part of the error estimation will be a perturbation analysis, which is also of independent interest and will therefore be explored as a separate research task {\bf(Work Package 2d)}.
We will analyse how perturbations of its parameters affect the distance between an imprecise continuous-time Markov chain and its perturbed version.
Such a perturbation analysis has been successfully applied to imprecise discrete-time Markov chains; we expect it to be equally successful in continuous time.

%*** Here I mean the problem of calculating the distances between the natural extensions of lower previsions, based on the differences obtained on their domains. That is what is $\max_{0\le f \le 1} |\underline E(f)-\underline E'(f)|$ if $ |\underline E(h)-\underline E'(h)|$ is given for every $h \in \mathcal H$. 
% 
% Another related problem is what is the maximal possible distance between two coherent lower previsions that coincide on a given set of gambles. 
% 
% The above results are needed if we want to calculate coefficients of ergodicity for $\overline T^n$ or $T_t$ in continuous time. 
%
% An indispensable tool for evaluating convergence in terms of how close are the results to the true values is the metric structure of the imprecise probability models. In this area a big gap exists between the theory and practice. We will reduce this gap by providing efficient methods for calculating the distances between imprecise probability models. The models of imprecise probabilities are usually evaluated as solutions of linear programming problems or, especially in the theory of imprecise Markov chains as sequences of several linear programming problems. Therefore a lot of computational effort is needed to obtain values of parameters, and consequently there is usually only a limited numbers of parameters at disposal. We will therefore look for the methods that will enable estimating the distances between imprecise probability models based on their partial identification. To solve this problem we will use methods of convex analysis and the theory of perturbations of linear programming problems.

As discussed, this computation-oriented research will benefit from the theoretical results in Research Line 1, and the respective researchers will be expected to collaborate. Similarly, the computational methods that we develop here (Work Package 2b and 2c) will benefit the study of limit distributions that we intend to conduct for Research Line 3 (Work Package 3b), because this study will involve computing limit distributions numerically; here too, the respective researchers will be expected to collaborate.

\emph{Limit behaviour and stationary distributions} {\bf (Research Line 3)}.\\[3pt]
Limit behaviour is a crucial topic in Markov chain theory, and if a unique stationary distribution exists, it is often a central object of interest. 
In the precise case, linear algebra provides powerful tools for the analysis of limit behaviour, but no such methods are available for imprecise Markov chains. 
For imprecise discrete-time Markov chains, alternative methods have been developed~\cite{cooman2008,hermans2012,skulj:13b,skulj2013}, but in continuous time, little is known so far~\cite{DeBock:2016:iCTMClimit,erreygers2017:ictmcs}. 
Therefore, our third main goal is to study the limit behaviour of imprecise continuous-time Markov chains more closely. 
We foresee three work packages:
% \vspace{6pt}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\tiny$\blacksquare$,leftmargin=*,noitemsep]
\item The first task will be to characterise the conditions under which the limit distribution of an imprecise continous-time Markov chain is stationary, in the sense that it does not depend on the initial state of the chain {\bf (Work Package 3a)}. 
In discrete time, such a study has already been conducted successfully~\cite{hermans2012,cooman2008,skulj2013}. 
In continuous time however, all that is known is a qualititive condition in terms of accessibility relations \cite{DeBock:2016:iCTMClimit}. Our goal is to develop quantitative characterisations that take into account the speed of convergence, using the coefficients of ergodicity of Work Package 2a.
\item Once we have established the existence of a stationary distribution, the next task will be to develop methods that allow us to compute it~{\bf (Work Package 3b)}. 
In the precise case, this is relatively easy, as it requires solving a linear system of equations. 
In the imprecise case, this system becomes non-linear, and solving it is far more difficult. 
We envision two approaches. 
The first option is to try and solve this system directly. 
We expect this to be feasible only in special cases. 
Whenever it is not, we will resort to the second option, which is to actually approach the limit up to some desired accuracy. 
Since this second option will clearly benefit from the results in Work Packages 2b and 2c, we intend for the respective researchers to collaborate on these topics.
\item A third task will be to analyse the structure of limit distributions: the types of classes the states belong to {\bf (Work Package 3c)}.
We expect this to be challenging because, due to their generality, imprecise continuous-time Markov chains will allow for a far richer range of classes of states and transitions between them than in the precise case. 
Our aim is to investigate the induced accessibility relations and their influence on convergence, especially when it is not unique, and to characterise and classify the invariant distributions. 
As a first step, we will extend the methodology in~\cite{skulj:13b} to continuous time. 
%---a partial classification of invariant sets for discrete-time imprecise Markov chains---
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Contingency plans} {\bf (Work Packages 4 \& 5)}.\\[3pt]
Although we expect to finish each work package, we might of course run into problems: some computations might be inherently intractable, or there might be theoretical questions we are unable to answer.
Even so, this would not endanger the aim of our project: to make significant progress in the field of continuous-time Markov chains.
Indeed, since this field is still essentially wide open, and because both project partners have been instrumental in developing the discrete-time version, it should not be a problem to make significant progress in each of the three proposed research lines.
Nevertheless, should we need to absorb major setbacks, the following additional research topics can serve as contingency plans.
They also serve as extra topics should the intended research proceed faster than expected.

First, as is clear from the discussion above, the proposed research does not work towards a specific application, nor does it try to build an ad-hoc model for some specific problem.
Rather, the aim is to develop a general theory of continuous-time Markov chains.
Nevertheless, our results can be used to study and solve a variety of practical problems.
Since real applications are an ideal testing ground for new theory, it would be nice to tackle such applications {\bf (Work Package 4)}; the choice of application will depend on the level of complexity that the developed framework will by then be able to deal with.

A second extra research topic is time reversibility.
This concept is very important for (precise) stochastic processes, but it has not yet been systematically studied in the framework of imprecision; to the best of our knowledge, the preliminary results in Reference~\cite{skulj2016} are the only exception.
Therefore, a systematic analysis of imprecise continuous-time reversible Markov chains {\bf (Work Package 5)} would definitely be an interesting research topic to pursue.

At the universities of Ghent and Ljubljana, a PhD fellowship, and therefore also the work on the proposed research, is usually spread over a period of four years.
We have indicated these four years in the table above, and have divided every year into four periods of three months (i.e.~quarters).
The work on the research has already been divided in work packages in the previous section.
For each work package, the table indicates the quarters during which we expect the researchers to be working on it.

We mark a box with a G to indicate that the research on that topic, in that specific quarter, will be led by the Ghent group (Gert de Cooman will lead WP1a-c, whereas Jasper de bock will lead WP3a-c); an L indicates that the research will be led by the Ljubljana group (Damjan \v{S}kulj). For some of the work packages, after the initial research on that topic has been carried out, we plan to visit each other to discuss the results, followed by joint work to finalise that part of the research; we indicate this in the table by marking the corresponding box with a B (which stands for `both'). These visits are expected to take place at the beginning of the second and third year of the project and will be attended by all project members. Depending on the outcome, these short visits can then be followed by a prolongued stay of the PhD students that are involved in a specific topic. As explained in the methodology section, this type of collaboration is essential for work packages WP1c, WP2b, WP2c and WP3b, because we expect the results that are obtained in these work packages to benefit from each other. For work packages WP2a, WP3a, WP3c, WP4 and WP5, the planned collaboration is not essential, but nevertheless recommended because both partners have a mutual interest and expertise in these topics.



After the work on a specific work package is finished, the results will be disseminated at research conferences and published in scientific journals. 
The last two quarters of the fourth year are intentionally left blank, because these will be reserved for writing the PhD theses.

\textbf{Indicate below whether you think the results of the proposed research will be suitable to be communicated to a non expert audience and how you would undertake such communication.}\\
\textit{FWO encourages its fellows to disseminate the results of their research widely, and valorize them where possible.}

Markov chains are definitely suitable for communication to a non-expert audience. 
Their basics are easy to explain to an audience with limited maths. 
Also, they can be used to describe many practical problems, ranging from basic strategies for playing certain games to demographic predictions, planning of workforce recruitment and promotion strategies. 
For example, UGhent research on queueing theory---which uses Markov chains extensively---has recently been cleverly applied to waiting in line at a festival bar, and its findings were easily picked up by several national media.
The addition of imprecision to such problems only increases their potential for communication to a non expert audience, because it allows us to include aspects such as safety, reliability and robustness, all of which are highly relevant to society.

In addition to purely educative or demonstrative purposes, Markov chains can also be used to develop relatively simple web-based tools that can serve to support business processes. 
The Slovenian group has been involved in the successful development of such a web-based platform for prediction and strategy testing for the structure of Slovenian armed forces. 
Such platforms would definitely benefit from models that allow for imprecision as well.
